/** Get the current canvas layout size, which depends on the current screen width
 *
 * The canvas "data" size is always 200x200, which exactly matches the number of
 * elections simulated. The docs says:
 *
 * > The [canvas] element can be sized arbitrarily by CSS, but during rendering
 * > the image is scaled to fit its layout size: if the CSS sizing doesn't
 * > respect the ratio of the initial canvas, it will appear distorted.
 *
 * So the "data" size of 200x200 is scaled by the browser the fit the CSS sizing,
 * which depends on the current screen width. Thus there is no problem in plotting
 * the data or setting its width and height attributes.
 *
 * However, dragging needs the actual canvas layout size, to calculate where
 * the pointer is on the grid, so this function has to be used
