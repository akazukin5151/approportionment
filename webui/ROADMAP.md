# refactor

use a proper hashmap for coalitions, only turn it into array for export

# UI
- add party button could float like run button
    - explore other toolbar ideas, like icons. text buttons looks big and noisy

- when they are lots of candidates, it's hard to distinguish between parties in coalition table, especially when randomly generated candidates ended up with a similar black color

- table headers
    - small caps for headers instead of bold (larger letter spacing if needed)
        - softer colors to blend in with header
    - look at examples like page 244, 130 and 158

- consider de emphasizing h4 section headers, as they're more like labels. maybe normal weight and center?

- consider icon for delete button

- better checkbox design (page 222)

- find one or two primary hue, vary colors along saturation/lightness
    - use for primary buttons, run button
- one or two accent color for sparklines

- page 251: pulsing colors for the "i"s in the h1
- page 216: background bleed on favicon
- page 232: full "header"/hero "favicon"
