This directory contains a fork of [simplecss](https://simplecss.org/) and the styles for [Github corners](https://tholman.com/github-corners/)

The styles for Github corners are moved here to satisfy HTML linters. There is no other change to the HTML and CSS.


The fork of simplecss has the following changes:

- removed styles for the `progress` HTML input element, as it turns the indeterminate progress bar animation into a blank bar.
- removed the grid layout in the `body` element
- made the white background color darker. This rule is here so that the background color for dark theme is preserved
